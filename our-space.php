                <p>Our current space is 57North Hacklab's third location, and the largest so far.  We have around TBC m2 which is separated into several zones for different activities.  The interior is a fairly normal modern open-plan office set-up with durable carpet and a suspended ceiling.</p>
                <p>There is plenty of space to host sit down meetings of perhaps up to 20 people, and the space probably has a comfortable capacity of around 30 or 40 people.</p>
                <p>Worth noting, the layout map below is probably out of date already.</p>
